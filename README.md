### Blockchain-Based Encrypted ML Model Management and Access Control System

## Overview
This project implements a decentralized system for managing and controlling access to machine learning models using SUI smart contracts and Arweave storage. The system leverages NFTs with dynamic fields to store access control information and encryption keys, providing a secure and flexible way to manage model access permissions.

## Architecture

### System Components

1. **Client Layer**
   - Model Creator Interface
   - Model User Interface

2. **Application Layer**
   - Python SDK
   - API Interface
   - Network Connection Module
   - Transaction Construction Module
   - Event Listener Module

3. **Blockchain Layer (SUI Smart Contracts)**
   - Model Registration Module
   - Access Control Module
   - Usage Tracking Module
   - Object Management Module
   - Parallel Processing Module
   - Event Management Module

4. **Storage Layer (Arweave)**
   - Data Management
   - Cache Management

5. **Security Layer**
   - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
   - Encryption Module
   - Capability Proofs

## Core Features

### 1. Model Publishing and NFT Minting
- Encrypted model storage on Arweave
- NFT creation with dynamic fields containing:
  - Model storage ID
  - Encryption keys
  - Allowed addresses list

### 2. Access Control Flow
1. Model owner uploads and encrypts the model
2. System stores encrypted model on Arweave
3. Smart contract mints NFT with access control information
4. Users request access permissions
5. Owner updates NFT dynamic fields to grant access
6. Authorized users can retrieve and decrypt models

### 3. Usage Tracking
- Real-time monitoring of model access
- Recording of usage statistics
- Access history maintenance

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Development (Move Language)
1. **Base Contracts**
   - ModelRegistry module
   - AccessControl module
   - UsageToken module
   - Cross-module interactions

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Object capability management
   - Access permission transfer
   - Usage rights verification
   - Event publishing

### Client Development
1. **SUI SDK Integration**
   - Network connection implementation
   - Contract interaction interface
   - Transaction construction
   - Event monitoring

2. **Interaction Workflows**
   - Model publishing process
   - Authorization management
   - Usage tracking

## Key Advantages of SUI Implementation

1. **Object Ownership Management**
   - Utilizes SUI's object model for ownership management
   - Enables precise access control
   - Supports permission transfer and delegation

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Leverages SUI's parallel execution capabilities
   - Enables concurrent model access
   - Optimizes batch processing

3. **Event System**
   - Real-time notification system
   - Model usage tracking
   - Authorization status monitoring

4. **Move Language Benefits**
   - Enhanced asset management security
   - Native resource type support
   - Improved formal verification
